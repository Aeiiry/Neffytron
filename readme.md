I suppose I should make this public.

## Setup

Create a virtual enviroment 
```
python -m venv /venv/
```
Activate it
```
(linux) source venv/bin/activate
```
Install requirements into the venv
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it out

Run it and marvel at how it logs into discord and does nothing
